# Gameboy-Demo-Kiosk-DemoBoy-II-
Everything necessary to produce the Gameboy Demo Kiosk / DemoBoy II.

I have a fever dream of being a kid when the gameboy was still on display in stores and seeing a gameboy kiosk where you could play the gameboy on a television while trying out a new game. I only saw this once in my life and young me was excited because I thought it meant I could take my gameboy at home and connect it to a TV. I never did figure out how to do that or why I couldn't, and I never saw one of those kiosks in stores again. 

Then the people at NESDEV showed me the existence of the gameboy kiosk, and this is what that was. With Hekymoze being kind of enough to share PCB scans and the BOM of a DemoBoy II in his possession and Lidnariq determining and sharing the JEDEC for a GAL 22V10 to replace the original AMPAL, I present to you the open source DemoBoy II. This thing can still be found on eBay for a considerable amount of money, and I still feel that those original systems are worth that for collectors. But, for those of us who just want to mess around with this thing without taking on a new house or car payment, happy making!

You will need to have a NES you don't mind harvesting components from to make this, as well as a game with an MMC5 or MMC5A chip inside. Everything else can be bought as new-old-stock or new stock COTS. 

Power should be supplied to the 5V connection on the PCB, not through the NES RF module, and I havent seen this draw more than 600 mA while powering the PCB and an attached MGB. A 5V 1A PSU should be more than sufficient. 

PCB Thickness: 1.6 mm
